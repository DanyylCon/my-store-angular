# MyStore

This is one of the projects for a Full-Stack course that I am taking. It is built with Angular. 
It has basic store functinality with a simple product list and cart. Different components are 
used throughout the application and services and Input()/Output() are used to share data between 
them. The data is generated by using HttpClient and subscribing to an Observable from a json file.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.1.

## Instructions

- Clone the project to your machine
- run npm install in the terminal to install dependencies (Bootstrap is used)
- run ng serve in the terminal to serve up the application on the address that will be displayed (Standard is http://localhost:4200/)
